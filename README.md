The Psychic Game

Guess what letter I'm thinking of: How to play
<br>
The computer selects a random letter from the alphabet and the user pushes any key from the alphabet.  If the user guess matches the computer guess then the user wins and the win score is increased by one. Each user guess will be logged under "Your guesses so far" on the scoreboard.  Letters may not be repeated during a game.  If the user guess does not match the computer guess, the guesses left decreases by one and the game resets.  The user has 9 chances to match the computer guess.   If the user guess does not match the computer guess and guesses left equals zero, then losses on the scoreboard is increased by one and the game resets.  The scoreboard will continue to keep track of wins, losses, and guesses left.
